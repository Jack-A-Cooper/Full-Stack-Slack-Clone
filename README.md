# Full Stack Slack Clone

Pair programmer: Emmanuel Pena

Summary:
RESTful, single-page, full-stack web application that mimics some of the features/UI of the website "Slack" (https://slack.com/). Lacks features due to time-constraints (~5-days), but it is deployable and has basic functionalities such as an authenticated login page, responsive-UI (mobile-first approach), user profile (sign-out, setting status, etc.), and workspace toggling/adding. Its purpose was to showcase all knowledge/skills as a final project for the course, and show the ability to develop a full-stack web application.

Tech-stack:
  Frontend: JavaScript, ReactJS, and Material-UI
  Backend: PostgreSQL, NodeJS (ExpressJS Framework)
  Middleware: Authentication (bcrypt, JSON web token), OpenAPI (YAML), Swagger-UI
